# MonoCode's design language

Use this when a draft shows MonoCode itself, or anything that should sit in it
without looking foreign. A draft already receives the real theme through CSS
variables, so prefer the variables to the hex values below; the numbers are what
the variables resolve to and the rules behind them.

## Surfaces

The window is dark frosted glass or solid light, chosen by the user. A draft
paints the content card's solid color as --background. Floating things (menus,
popovers, dialogs) are --popover with a 1px --border, 12px corners and a two
layer shadow: 0 20px 25px -5px and 0 8px 10px -6px, both black at 10%.

## Ink, not grey

Nothing is a fixed grey. Text and every fill are the theme's ink at an alpha, so
they follow dark, light and custom themes.

| Role | Ink alpha | Variable |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Primary text | 100% | --foreground |
| Button text | 80% | |
| Muted text, labels | 60% | --muted-foreground |
| Captions, hints | 45–55% | |
| Pane separator hairline | 4% | |
| Card border | 8–10% | --border |
| Button and input border | 12% | --input |
| Card fill | 3% | --card |
| Hover, chip, secondary fill | 6% | --muted, --secondary |
| Selected row or tab | 10% | |

The accent (default #4da3f5) is --accent. Its tinted fill is --accent-surface
(16%), text on that fill --accent-surface-foreground. Focus is a 1px accent
border, not a glow. Status colors: --success #10b981, --warning #f59e0b,
--destructive #f43f5e, --info #38bdf8, each with a -surface tint at 16%.

## Shape and type

Corners: 6px for controls and tabs (--radius-sm), 8px (--radius), 12px for
cards, popovers and the composer (--radius-lg). Cards are borders and a 3% fill,
never shadows. Type is the system UI font: 13px body (--font-size), 12px for
controls and labels, 11px for captions, 15px for a section title at weight 600.
Numbers that change use tabular figures. Weights are 400 and 500; 600 is for
titles and big numbers only.

## Sizes

Title bar 40px. Pane header 36px, with a 1px bottom hairline. Tab plate 27px,
6px corners, 4% fill that goes to 7% on hover and 10% when selected. Controls
28px (24px small). Icon buttons 20px with a 14px icon at 55% ink that rises to
100% on hover. Right panel 220–640px wide. The conversation column is at most
832px wide and centered. Icons are the hugeicons stroke set at 1.5–1.75px
(mc.icon has the common ones).

## The shell

Left: a project rail and the sidebar of conversations, each row 28px with a
6px status dot (green running, amber waiting). Top: session tabs on the title
bar. Center: the conversation, with the user's messages as right-aligned
bubbles at 8% ink and the agent's as plain text. Bottom: the composer, a 12px
rounded card with the input above a row of small controls (model, effort)
and a primary Send button. Right: the project panel with Explorer, History and
Terminal tabs.

## With the kit

The mc kit already follows all of this: mc-card, mc-button (and primary,
ghost, small), mc-input, mc-tabs and mc-tab, mc-badge, mc-menu, mc-kbd,
mc-stat. Reach for them first, then spacing of 8, 12 and 16.
